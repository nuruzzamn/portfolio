                                    Things that were done manually have little space nowadays in the digital world. And not just space but the need to pace things up is also an important factor. More developers are turning to automated code reviews because of this. <br> <br> Automated code review is the process of reviewing source codes automatically with predefined parameters to eliminate human errors, and identify any inefficiencies in the code. Automation tools are used in finding bugs and locating potential vulnerabilities by alerting developers throughout the code review process to see if the code conforms to company guidelines. <br> <br> Automated code review solutions are typically coupled with Git-based repository hosting services like Github, Gitlab, or Codecommit. It performs a compile-time analysis of the code to see if it complies with the established requirements. <br><br> This is one of the latest web development technologies that are booming slowly in tech companies. With its highlighted benefits of sped-up and accurate code reviews, this technology can be rightly said to advance and prove to be beneficial in the coming years. <br><br> Codacy, DeepSource, CodeScene, and Codebrag are some of the well-known automated code review tools that many companies can make use of to efficiently scale up their websites and applications.
