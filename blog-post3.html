                                <p><h3>4. Dark mode standardization</h3></p>

                                <p>The dark mode is a feature that inverts the colors of a website or web application, making the background dark and the text light to reduce eye strain and improve readability in low-light environments. Providing a dark mode option can help to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Another use of dark mode standardization is energy savings. When a device displays a dark interface, the screen uses less power, which can help to extend battery life. This is especially beneficial for mobile devices and laptops, as users can save battery power and use their devices for longer periods.

                                <p><h3>9. Cloud-based development and deployment</h3></p>

                                <p>One of the main advantages of cloud-based development and deployment is scalability. With cloud-based infrastructure, organizations can easily scale their web applications to handle increased traffic or demand without the need for expensive hardware upgrades. Another benefit is cost savings associated with server and data center setup and maintenance.
                                <br>
                                Cloud-based development and deployment also enable collaboration and productivity. Developers can easily share and access code and other resources regardless of their location. There are several popular cloud-based platforms for web development and deployment, such as DigitalOcean, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Each of these platforms offers a wide range of services and tools for web application development and deployment, including storage, databases, and serverless computing.     
                                </p>

                                <p><h3>10. Serverless architecture</h3></p>

                                <p>Following the cloud-based development and deployment trend described above, we come to the serverless architecture trend. The term "serverless" refers to the fact that the infrastructure and servers required to run a web application are managed by a third-party provider rather than being maintained by the business or developer.
                                <br>
                                The main benefits of serverless architecture are cost savings and scalability. Because a third-party provider manages the infrastructure and servers, businesses and developers don't have to worry about the costs associated with setting up and maintaining their own servers. Furthermore, with serverless infrastructure, web applications can automatically scale to handle increased traffic or demand without needing expensive hardware upgrades. This can help to ensure that the website or web application remains available and responsive, even during periods of high traffic. Additionally, serverless architecture allows easy integration with other services and tools, such as databases and storage, which can speed up the development process.

                                <p>Cybercrime is at an all-time high thanks to the growing number of opportunities for hackers to exploit. Asking users to log in to your website via their Facebook account or other social media credentials is no longer recommended. Consumers are thinking harder about who they share their information with, so don't ask for data that you don't need. If you have a large database of user information stored on your servers, consider introducing multi-factor identification.
